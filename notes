2 phases of execution
   1) parsing scene description file 
   2) main rendering loop (clearly most time spent here)

Parsing produces Scene obj and Renderer obj
   Scene specifies contents of the scene
   Renderer implements rendering algorithm

Scene file format specified in docs/fileformat.pdf.
File format user guide docs/usersguide.pdf.

Things I'm learning:
 - When it's ok to let data be public
     - ex. vectors, points, normals, rays
 - What data to store, and which things can be computed on the go
     - ex. a vector's length is computed on the go
 - Having access to all fields at once
     - ex. ray time for motion blur. I'm not going to implement motion blur for
       a while, but the data is here.
 - Naming variables conventiently
     - ex. Ray origin and direction can be stored as "o" and "d"
